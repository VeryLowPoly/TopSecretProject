This is a reference so that we can easily depict how we should set up sprites and how sprites have
been globally set up. This aims to make it easier to create more things in the game later on


--- NAMING CONVENTIONS ---
the prefix for naming a sprite is:

spr_

===========================
Player Sprites:

a player sprite for an animation would go as follows

spr_Player/CharacterName_Animation

(spr_player_attack1)
===========================
Background Sprites:

bg_BackgroundName
===========================
Tileset Sprites:
spr_tsTILESETNAME
===========================
Everything else can be named whatever you want it to afterwards
