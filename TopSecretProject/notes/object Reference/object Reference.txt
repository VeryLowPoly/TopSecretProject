Collision objects will work as solid objects unless they're "fall-through platforms"
where a player would press down and fall through them, or jump up through them from
underneath them

Any objects we might need to make solid but don't want to write out collision checks

Take that object and set "obj_CollisionParent" as it's Parent in the dropdown menu of
the object itself
